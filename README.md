# Machine_Learning
This repository is created from scratch. Learning is the main purpose of this repository. Here I will implement some trending machine learning algorithms and will describe precise theory behind the algorithms.

<b>Machine learning</b> is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
Types of Machine Learning:
1) Supervised Machine Learning  
  => Regression  
    - Linear Regression  
    - Polynomial Regression
  => Decision Tree  
  => Random Forest  
  => Classification  
    - KNN  
    - Logistic Regression  
    - Naive Bayes  
    - SVM  
2) Unsupervised Machine Learning  
  => Clustering  
    - SVD  
    - PCA  
    - K-means  
    - Hierarchical Clustering
  => Hidden Markov Model (HMM)  
3) Reinforcement Learning  
4) Recommender System  
  => Content Based  
  => Collaborative  
    - User Based  
    - Item Based
