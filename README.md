# Machine_Learning
This repository is created from scratch. Learning is the main purpose of this repository. Here I will implement some trending machine learning algorithms and will describe precise theory behind the algorithms.

<b>Machine learning</b> is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
