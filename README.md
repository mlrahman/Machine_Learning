# Machine_Learning
This repository is created from scratch. Learning is the main purpose of this repository. Here I will implement some trending machine learning algorithms and will describe precise theory behind the algorithms.

<b>Machine learning</b> is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
Types of Machine Learning:
1) Supervised Machine Learning</br>
  => Regression</br>
    - Linear Regression</br>
    - Polynomial Regression</br>

  => Decision Tree</br>
  => Random Forest</br>
  => Classification</br>
    - KNN</br>
    - Logistic Regression</br>
    - Naive Bayes</br>
    - SVM</br>

2) Unsupervised Machine Learning</br>
  => Clustering</br>
    - SVD</br>
    - PCA</br>
    - K-means</br> 
    - Hierarchical Clustering</br>

  => Hidden Markov Model (HMM)</br>

3) Reinforcement Learning</br>

4) Recommender System</br>
  => Content Based</br>
  => Collaborative</br>
    - User Based</br>
    - Item Based</br>
