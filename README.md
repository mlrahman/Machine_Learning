# Machine_Learning
This repository is created from scratch. Learning is the main purpose of this repository. Here I will implement some trending machine learning algorithms and will describe precise theory behind the algorithms.

<b>Machine learning</b> is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

<h3>Terminologies of Machine Learning:</h3> 
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Feature:</b> Unique characteristics of an object. It helps to identify an object from others. Calculating feature data from input is known as <b>feature extraction.</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Labelled data:</b>It indicates that for a dataset true output is defined against some features. In supervised learning we provide labelled data in a machine. On the other hand, <b>unlabelled data</b> refers data features in dataset without true output.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Response variable:</b> Result of a machine after analyzing features from dataset. Simply we can say output of an algorithm.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Training Data:</b> Data which used to train the machine is known as training data.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Test Data:</b> Data which used to measuring the performance(accuracy) of an algorithm after completing the training process. <b>Note:</b> Training and testing data chosen randomly from a dataset.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Validation Data:</b> It is a part of training data. It helps to measure the performance for tuning the parameters of a model.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Cross validation:</b> It is totally different from validation data. It is used for proper judgement of the performance(accuracy) in a model. Cross-validation is primarily used in applied machine learning to estimate the skill of a machine learning model on unseen data. That is, to use a limited sample in order to estimate how the model is expected to perform in general when used to make predictions on data not used during the training of the model. <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/k-fold-cross-validation/" target="_blank">Details..</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Hypothesis:</b> Machine learning, specifically supervised learning, can be described as the desire to use available data to learn a function that best maps inputs to outputs. Technically, this is a problem called function approximation, where we are approximating an unknown target function (that we assume exists) that can best map inputs to outputs on all possible observations from the problem domain. The collection of all the possible hypothesis is known as <b>hypothesis space</b>. Among hypothesis space if we get best result from any hypothesis then it's called <b>final hypothesis</b>.
