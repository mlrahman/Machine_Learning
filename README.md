# Machine_Learning
This repository is created from scratch. Learning is the main purpose of this repository. Here I will implement some trending machine learning algorithms and will describe precise theory behind the algorithms.

<b>Machine learning</b> is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

<h3>Terminologies of Machine Learning:</h3> 
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Feature:</b> Unique characteristics of an object. It helps to identify an object from others. Calculating feature data from input is known as <b>feature extraction.</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Labelled data:</b>It indicates that for a dataset true output is defined against some features. In supervised learning we provide labelled data in a machine. On the other hand, <b>unlabelled data</b> refers data features in dataset without true output.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Response variable:</b> Result of a machine after analyzing features from dataset. Simply we can say output of an algorithm.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Training Data:</b> Data which used to train the machine is known as training data.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Test Data:</b> Data which used to measuring the performance(accuracy) of an algorithm after completing the training process. <b>Note:</b> Training and testing data chosen randomly from a dataset.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Validation Data:</b> It is a part of training data. It helps to measure the performance for tuning the parameters of a model.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Cross validation:</b> It is totally different from validation data. It is used for proper judgement of the performance(accuracy) in a model. Cross-validation is primarily used in applied machine learning to estimate the skill of a machine learning model on unseen data. That is, to use a limited sample in order to estimate how the model is expected to perform in general when used to make predictions on data not used during the training of the model. <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/k-fold-cross-validation/" target="_blank">Details..</a>
